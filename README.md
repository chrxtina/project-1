# Project 1: Tic Tac Toe


## Features

- User sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and change password
- Play game via create new or join existing game
- Retrieve total number games of user

## Technologies Used:

- Javascript
- Boostrap
- SCSS/Sass
- AJAX
- jQuery

## Planning

- Created wireframe of game
- Collected resources like game-project-api, js-template, and spec
- Reviewed documentation of technologies
- Spoke with peers to better understand the client/server relationship

## Development Process

I started with creating a basic HTML/CSS skeleton in order to better visualize things and see how to start implementing functionality. Then, I moved on to setting up user authentication because it was the most straightforward for me. In order to work on the game, I had to do some extra reading and have discussions with classmates because I was treating the game as if it was dependent on the API. However, after better understanding the separation of components, I was quickly able to figure out the game logic and THEN implement connections with the API. Lastly, I worked on the layout and style once everything was functioning adequately.

## Unsolved Problems and Next Steps

- Not responsive
- Code not completely DRY, needs a lot of refactoring
- Storing/retrieving game winners from database
- Allowing users to play one game from separate computers
